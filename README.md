# gwt-react-router
GWT Java bindings for React Router

##Introduction

gwt-react-router provides Java [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) bindings based on the
new JsInterop capabilities introduced in GWT 2.8 for [react-router 2.3.0](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)

This project depends on [gwt-react](https://github.com/GWTReact/gwt-react)

***Please note: the project currently only works with a Snapshot build of GWT 2.8. Consider this project a preview. The API is only partially complete at this point and is highly likely to change.***

##Getting Started

Please take a look at the [gwt-react-examples](https://github.com/GWTReact/gwt-react-examples) project for
details on how to use the library.

* **artifactId**&nbsp;&nbsp;gwt-react-router

##Roadmap
